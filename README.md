# Bot-Server
A game that is meant to be played by two computers. Based on the game played in _Ender's Game_
  
###Building  
To build a jar of the server you must first install jRuby and the Bundler gem.  
Then you run `bundle install` to install all the project dependencies  
To actually build the jar you run `rake build`  
The server jar can now be found in the build directory  
  
###To-Do  
- Enforce a turn timer on the AIs

###Exploits  
Using exploits that you find are legal *if*:  
- You report them to me (Jake Kinsella). Send it through an email so nobody else will alerted of the bug
- You are given permission to use the bug. The only times we will patch the bug is if the exploit is to powerful, or it is really easy to implement, or if it crashes the server
- You found this exploit out by yourself. If a exploit is found one the internet then it will be patched
  
If you are found to be using an exploit that is either illegal or unlisted then your match results will be invalidated.  
All exploits are listed below (without giving away implementation). If you think you have found one check with me (Jake Kinsella) to be sure that it is new.  
*No exploits have been found so far*
